# CoreClub
I have been working this last weeks for making a new core for you guys, it has new rank system via MySQL and punishment system

Installation
1. Pull the latest version of CoreClub or download it here.(located in project directory)
2. Add it to your project's build path. (Note: Make sure to extract CoreClub.jar into your output path, so people don't need to add CoreClub into their server!)
3. Change the mysql password
4. Done you can use it

Requirements:

- MySQL
